<h1>Understanding Plagiarism</h1>
</head>

<body>
<p>Plagiarism refers to the act of using someone else's work, ideas, or intellectual property without proper acknowledgment or permission, presenting it as one's own. It violates intellectual property (IP) rights and is considered unethical and, in many cases, illegal. Plagiarism can occur in various domains, including academic research, literature, music, art, and digital content.</p>
